# SEPT-Project

This assignment is about developing a full-stack application for a telemedicine service for a private clinic called Neighborhood Doctors. The back-end will be implemented using Java and the SpringBoot framework, and the front-end using Dart and Flutter. The purpose of the assignment is to simulate a software design and development team working on a contract with Neighborhood Doctors. The team will be following all software engineering principles throughout the production. The final application, named "ND Telemedicine App", will allow patients to sign up, add their health information, book appointments with doctors, chat with them, and view their prescribed medicines. On the other hand, doctors can add their availabilities, prescribe and manage medicine, and view their patients' health status. There is also a super admin user to manage both types of users and send notifications for appointments or medicine reminders. The application should have the common and main features, but the team can discuss and make changes with the product owner (tutor). The team will be responsible for finalizing the design and requirements for the application.

This is the repository for Group 6 (Thursday 4:30 class) for Software Engineering Process and Tools
